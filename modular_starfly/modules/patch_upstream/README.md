# Upstream Bandage

Module ID: `PATCH_UPSTREAM`

## Description

Not everything that comes downstream is perfect. Sometimes we've got to patch
over a rough spot until they can fix it upstream. This module takes care of
disabling and removing those areas.

Note: This module is used to remove things for **technical** reasons. Things
removed for thematic reasons are done in their own modules.

## TG Proc/File Changes

- N/A
<!-- If you edited any core procs, you should list them here. You should specify the files and procs you changed.
E.g:
- `code/modules/mob/living.dm`: `proc/overriden_proc`, `var/overriden_var`
-->

## Modular Overrides

- N/A
<!-- If you added a new modular override (file or code-wise) for your module, you should list it here. Code files should specify what procs they changed, in case of multiple modules using the same file.
E.g:
- `modular_starfly/master_files/sound/my_cool_sound.ogg`
- `modular_starfly/master_files/code/my_modular_override.dm`: `proc/overriden_proc`, `var/overriden_var`
-->

## Defines

- N/A
<!-- If you needed to add any defines, mention the files you added those defines in, along with the name of the defines. -->

## Included files that are not contained in this module

- N/A
<!-- Likewise, be it a non-modular file or a modular one that's not contained within the folder belonging to this specific module, it should be mentioned here. Good examples are icons or sounds that are used between multiple modules, or other such edge-cases. -->
